Ideas for side projects to implement during the covid-19 lockdown

## Motivation
For the past 6 months or so I've been working on re-writing a legacy system and even though it is a challenging problem, it did not provide me with any challenging coding exercises, (i.e understanding the old system is hard, implementitation is failry straight forward). During the covid-10 lockdown my mental burnout got amplified. So this is my attempt to do some coding therapy :)
